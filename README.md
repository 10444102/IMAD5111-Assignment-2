Please note that the project is in a zip file due to the fact that Github does not allow me to submit a project this large, and I have tried almost everything to scale it down, but I was still unsuccesfull. Below the report I attached images showing the problem.

1. Introduction
The Tamagotchi App is a delightful virtual pet application designed to bring joy and entertainment to users of all ages. Similar to the popular Talking Tom app, our Talkative Buddy features a cute and lovable character that responds to user interactions in amusing ways.

2. Design Overview
The Tamagotchi app consists of several screens, with the second screen being the focus of this report. Here’s an overview of the design:

Second Screen:
User Interaction: After being greeted on the first screen, the user clicks a button to proceed.
Dynamic Dog Image: The picture of the dog changes based on the button pressed. For example:
If the user clicks the “Feed” button, the dog image might show a full bowl of food.
If the user clicks the “Play” button, the dog image could depict the pet playing with a toy.
Similarly, the “Clean” button would trigger an image showing a clean and happy dog.
Status Bars:
Three progress bars indicate the pet’s current status:
HUNGER: Represents the pet’s hunger level.
HAPPINESS: Reflects the pet’s overall happiness.
CLEANLINESS: Indicates how clean the pet is.
Additional Options:
Icons on the right side of the screen likely provide access to other features or settings.

3. Purpose
The Tamagotchi app serves the following purposes:

Entertainment: Users can interact with their virtual pet, nurturing it and watching it respond.
Engagement: The dynamic dog image and status bars encourage users to take care of their pet.
Customization: The changing dog image adds variety and personalization.

4. Utilization Steps
Running the App: Once the app/code is in android studio a emulator is needed to run the code Preferably Pixel 2 Api 26 to avoid any problems with the app.
User Interaction: Once the app opens users will be greeted by their pet and a clickable button that will get their game started. After clicking the button users are taken to a second screen with 3 buttons “CLEAN, FEED, PLAY’. Each of these buttons will change the image of the dog depending on what button is pushed.
Customization: Currently there are no customizations to be made for the users pet.
5. Conclusion
The Tamagotchi app combines nostalgia with modern interactivity, making it a delightful experience for users. By following the utilization steps, users can enjoy their virtual pet and keep it happy and healthy!
